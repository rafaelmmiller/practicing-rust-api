# Practicing Rust Backend Development with "Real-World" Projects

Idea is to create 4 simple projects to learn how to use Rust for backend development with "real-world" examples.

## 1st Project

- REST API "e-commmerce"
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE product
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE order
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE user
    - JWT login, register, logout
    - roles: admin, user

- Docker
- SQLite + InMemory Database
- Unit tests
- DDD:
  - Repository Pattern (with abstract repo)
  - Usecases
  - Controllers, Routes

## 2nd Project

Same as 1st project but using graphql

## 3rd Project

Webhook implementation (?)

## 4th Project

Websocket implementation. Online game? idk

Learning log:

- wtf with that many mod.rs files?
